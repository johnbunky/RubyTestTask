# RubyTestTask

My first experience in UI test automation, and  ruby first time in general:)

Simple project consist of three main files:
- test.rb that contains a test logic
- methods.rb that contains a test logic implementation
- pages.rb that contain a page object classes

The test run from command line with command `ruby test.rb`
